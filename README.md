I’m a full-stack developer, passionate about building things. My main language is JavaScript, and I love working with TypeScript for the added structure. Most of the time, you’ll find me working on the frontend in React.js, but I also enjoy the occasional shift in perspective with backend technologies. 😊

Recently, I’ve been diving into Python and Go to expand my horizons and explore different approaches to solving problems. 
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me outside with my perfect girlfriend or tinkering with old computers.
