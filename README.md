## Job 🧑‍💼

I am currently looking for a job in Prague. 

I am willing to do front-end and back-end with `JavaScript`, though `Typescript` is preffered. 
And I really want to apply my `Go` skills, so perhaps back-end or anything with `Go` would be awesome!

experiences with: `Preact, React, Redux-toolkit + Query, Deno, node.js, express.js, JWT, Prisma, Tailwind css, bootstrap, SASS (with scss syntax)`
