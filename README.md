Iâ€™m a full-stack developer, passionate about building things. My main language is JavaScript, and I love working with TypeScript for the added structure it bringsâ€”especially handy on larger projects. Most of the time, youâ€™ll find me working on the frontend in React.js, but I also enjoy the occasional shift in perspective with Python and backend technologies. ðŸ˜Š

Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into Golang to expand my horizons and explore different approaches to solving problems beyond JavaScript. 
When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me outside with my perfect girlfriend or tinkering with old computers.
